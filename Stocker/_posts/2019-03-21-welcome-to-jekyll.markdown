What was the overall architecture of your system?

The architecture of stocker is based on a 3 tier architecture. One layer for Logic, Presentation, and Persistence. This is all then on top of the Domain model.

What went wrong in the development process?

Being our first time round developing an application in android studio many technical and time management challenges had to be addressed. Everyone needed to learn how to be proficient with android studio as well as agree on standards so as to not lead to issues down the road. This lead a lot of development to be slower than initially planned, pushing a lot of desired features/user stories to be done later than expected. 

How did the project change from your initial (iteration 0) vision or stories, or did it work out as predicted?

Most of our initially planned features and user stories stayed fairly consistent. Some tweaks were made as we realized some aspects were not realistically feasible within our current understanding and time crunch. Some User stories were cut much later, as we had to start them before realizing that the way we intended them to work, just wasn't gonna happen.
 
What did you learn about team or large project development? What will you start doing, keep doing, or stop doing next time?

COMMUNICATION!! Being socially awkward Comp sci majors and having to realize that when you need help, or someone else needs help. You need to be able to effectively explain and communicate your understanding of the dilemma and voice your concerns if you have any. We will definitely continue the philosophy of frequent scrum meetings to maintain group efficacy. We probably will stop having “unimportant” meetings over instant messaging apps.

Can we draw any conclusions from what we've done?

The below meme describes all conclusions we came to.
