# Stocker Vision Statement


Stocker is a mobile application used by the Operator(OP) of a small business to manage and analyze products/services, sales, and orders. 

Stocker will be designed for use on a mobile device by a single OP, or a small number of OPs in a shop-like setting whom all have authorized access to all business functions and data. 

Stocker will provide tools to view and manage inventory, and/or services, sales, orders, and customers, as well as the ability to assign "alert" notifications to critical situations requiring attention. Stocker will also collect data and implement visual data representation to conduct analysisâ€™ of transactions such as orders, and sales over time, and comparisons between products and/or services. 

This system will be a significant improvement over systems which require the implementation of a variety of different digital, and/or paper-based tools for inventory management and business analysis.
Through the use of Stocker as a single portable system, the management of primary business functions, as well as large amounts of relevant data analysis, become available to OPs anywhere and anytime. The visualization of trends, such as sales and orders, will facilitate a deeper understanding of the data, and as a result of its collection and accessible presentation, educated assessments of data can be made by OPs quickly and conveniently. The use of Stocker's customizable alerts will better enable OPs to schedule critical business functions and immediately attend to conditions of interest, such as preemptively ordering high-demand items to avoid loss of potential sales.

There will be three criteria to gauge the success of the system. Firstly, if after six months an increase in overall profits is assessed of at least 5% over numbers initially projected without Stocker. Secondly, a decrease of at least 15% in the amount of time required by an OP in managing inventory and conducting primary business functions. Finally, an increase in OP satisfaction measured by survey comparing experiences using Stocker against experiences using a previous system. If any of the criteria show a significant improvement, without a statistically-significant reduction in the other two, the system will be considered a success.
