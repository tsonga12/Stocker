Stocker is a group project of COMP3350-Software Engineering 1 at University of Manitoba in Winter 2019. The purpose of this project is to help students 
experience with the process of making software and how to turn it into the real product by building a mobile application using 3-tier architecture 
(Presentation, Logic, Persistence), and different levels of testing (Unit, Integration, Acceptance). Our project is the inventory management software which 
helps the operator of a small business to manage and analyze products/services, sales, and orders.

##  How to run our application

In order to run Stocker you need to clone our project, there are two ways of doing this

1) Using the command line. Type in

git clone https://code.cs.umanitoba.ca/comp3350-winter2019/stocker.git

then use any IDE that supports Android platform to open the application (We recommend you using Android Studio). After loading the application, simply hit
run button in the navigation bar of the IDE you are using.

2) Clone the project directly in IDE that is integrated with git and Android platform (Again, we recommend you using Android Studio).
After loading the application, simply hit run button in the navigation bar of the IDE you are using.
